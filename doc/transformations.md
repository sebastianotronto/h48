Transformations can be either simple rotations or a rotation composed
with a mirroring.  A composed rotation + mirror is obtained by applying
the corresponding rotation to the solved cube mirrored along the M plane.

For example, to apply the transformation RBm (mirrored RB) to a cube C:
	1. Apply a mirror along the M plane to the solved cube
	2. Rotate the mirrored cube with z' y2
	3. Apply the cube C to the transformed solved cube
	4. Apply the transformations of step 2 in reverse
	5. Apply the transformations of step 1 in reverse
