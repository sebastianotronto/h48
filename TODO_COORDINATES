- filter solutions
  - allow not showing repeated solutions like R2 F and R2 F' for EO
  - avoid B2 F as an EO
- in nissy.c, check for minmoves, maxmoves and nissflag (must be in range)
- add a dispatcher in solvers.h?
- test solver for EO (with unit test or tool)
- add NISS (and add tests for NISS EO)
- make solve parallelized
- other coordinates
  - gendata must handle symmetry
- make gendata parallelized

- refactor common parts of coord and h48 solvers
- move parse_h48 to h48 module?
  then maybe do like for coordinate and exclude the "h48" part
